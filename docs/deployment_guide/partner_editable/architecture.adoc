Deploying this Quick Start for a new virtual private cloud (VPC) with
default parameters builds the following {partner-product-short-name} environment in the
AWS Cloud.

image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture-diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* Amazon Route 53 for VPN load balancing and Cloud Native Firewall (CNFW) health monitoring.
* Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) for Kubernetes orchestration of the Cisco Secure Firewall cluster, including the Redirector, Control Point, and Enforcement Point.
* Amazon Elastic File Service (Amazon EFS) for elastic file systems for the Control Point and Enforcement Point.
* Amazon ElastiCache for Redis to store information on VPN sessions. The Redirector pod uses this information for smart load balancing and recovery.
* In the public subnets:
** Secure Firewall Cloud Native Redirector for load balancing of remote access virtual private network (VPN) traffic.
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** Secure Firewall Cloud Native Control Point in an Auto Scaling group for configuration validation, licensing, and route management.
** Secure Firewall Cloud Native Enforcement Point for termination of VPN sessions and forwarding of traffic.
** Cloud Native Firewall (CNFW) Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI) in an Auto Scaling group.
* In the public subnets:
** Cloud Native Firewall (CNFW) Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI) in an Auto Scaling group.

// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.
