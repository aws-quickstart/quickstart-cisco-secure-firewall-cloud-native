This Quick Start reference deployment guide provides architectural considerations and configuration steps for deploying a Cisco Secure Firewall Cloud Native on the AWS Cloud. It uses Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) and AWS Route 53 to build a scalable edge-containerized firewall cluster that scales based on VPN session load. The guide addresses common scalability and resiliency requirements for secured access to applications hosted in AWS infrastructure. 

This guide helps IT architects, network administrators, and DevOps/SecOps professionals implement a scalable Cisco Remote Access Virtual Private Network (RA-VPN) on the AWS cloud. It also provides links for viewing and launching AWS CloudFormation templates that automate the deployment.
