//Include any postdeployment steps here, such as steps necessary to test that the deployment was successful. If there are no postdeployment steps leave this file empty.

== Postdeployment steps

// Add steps as necessary for accessing the software, post-configuration, and testing. Donâ€™t include full usage instructions for your software, but add links to your product documentation for that information.
//Should any sections not be applicable, remove them

== Test the deployment
// If steps are required to test the deployment, add them here. If not, remove the heading

. After the Quick Start is deployed, run the following commands to check the {partner-product-short-name} cluster.

    export NS=<namespace>
    aws eks --region <region> update-kubeconfig --name <sfcn-cluster-name>
+
For example:

    export NS=sfcn-system
    aws eks --region us-east-1 update-kubeconfig --name answami-sfcn

. Check pods. 

    kubectl get pods -n $NS

. Check nodes.

    kubectl get nodes -n $NS

. Check CNFW configuration.

    kubectl get asacommand -A --field-selector spec.command="show run"

. You can capture different metrics for the SFCN based on service roles. For more information, refer to https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/secure-firewall/cloud-native/getting-started/secure-firewall-cloud-native-gsg/sfcn-metrics.html[Metrics Configuration^].

== Configure CNFW firewalls
// If post-deployment steps are required, add them here. If not, remove the heading

Once the {partner-product-short-name} cluster, nodes, and pods are running, configure CNFW firewalls.
 
. Clone the https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/sfcn.git[Cisco Secure Firewall Github Repository^]
. Modify the YAML files in the `sfcn/samples/` repository folder to suit your configuration. 
.. `sfcn/samples/basic` contains sample interface, network, access-list, and routes files.
.. `sfcn/samples/ra-vpn/redirector-lb/` contains sample RA-VPN files.
.. `sfcn/samples/ra-vpn/s2s-backhaul/` contains sample DC backhaul files.

. For each YAML file modified, apply your modifications with the following command.
    
    kubectl apply -f <filename>.yaml

== Best practices for using {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
// Provide post-deployment best practices for using the technology on AWS, including considerations such as migrating data, backups, ensuring high performance, high availability, etc. Link to software documentation for detailed information.
