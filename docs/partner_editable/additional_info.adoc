// Add steps as necessary for accessing the software, post-configuration, and testing. Donâ€™t include full usage instructions for your software, but add links to your product documentation for that information.
//Should any sections not be applicable, remove them

== Test the deployment
// If steps are required to test the deployment, add them here. If not, remove the heading

* Once Cisco Secure Firewall Cloud Native stack is deployed, run the following commands to check the SFCN cluster

    export NS=<namespace>
    aws eks --region <region> update-kubeconfig --name <sfcn-cluster-name>

  Example:
    export NS=sfcn-system
    aws eks --region us-east-1 update-kubeconfig --name answami-sfcn

* Check pods using *kubectl get pods -n $NS*

* Check nodes using *kubectl get nodes -n $NS*

* Check CNFW configuration using *kubectl get asacommand -A --field-selector spec.command="show run"*

== Post-deployment steps
// If post-deployment steps are required, add them here. If not, remove the heading

* Once the Cisco Secure Firewall Cloud Native cluster is up i.e., nodes and pods are up, access GitHub samples to configure CNFW firewalls. 
* Cisco Secure Firewall Github Repository: https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/sfcn
* Clone this https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/sfcn.git
* Go to sfcn/samples/
* Check basic folder for interface, network, access-list and routes sample YAML file 
* Go to sfcn/samples/ra-vpn/redirector-lb/ for RAVPN sample YAML file 
* Go to sfcn/samples/ra-vpn/s2s-backhaul/ for DC backhaul sample YAML file 
* Make changes to YAML file and apply it using kubectl apply -f <filename>.yaml

== Best practices for using {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
// Provide post-deployment best practices for using the technology on AWS, including considerations such as migrating data, backups, ensuring high performance, high availability, etc. Link to software documentation for detailed information.

* Deploy Cisco Secure Firewall Cloud Native with a minimum of two enforcement points.
* For resiliency, Cisco recommends using RAVPN with SFCN redirector and elasticache for Redis.
* Cisco recommends using EFS storage. 

== Other useful information
//Provide any other information of interest to users, especially focusing on areas where AWS or cloud usage differs from on-premises usage.

Cisco CNGW (containerized firewall) uses Cisco ASA configuration. You can use ASA CLI in the YAML file.
