.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* One VPC per Cisco Secure Firewall Cloud Native (SFCN).
** The VPC spans two Availability Zones configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices.
** The Cisco Secure Firewall Cloud Native cluster uses Amazon EKS to build resiliency and provide multi-az architecture.
* Amazon Route53 provides VPN load balancing and CNFW health monitoring
* In the public subnets:
** The Cisco Secure Firewall Cloud Native Control Point (CP) is responsible for configuration, licensing, and route management.
** The Cisco Secure Firewall Cloud Native Enforcement Point (EP) is responsible for handling traffic.
** The Cisco Secure Firewall Cloud Native architecture uses two autoscale groups (one for the control point and other one for the enforcement point).
** One EFS per cluster for Cisco Secure Firewall Cloud Native CP and EP (optional).
** ElastiCache for Redis and SFCN redirector are optional components for intelligent VPN load balancing.
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.

// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.
// * <describe any additional components>.

//[.small]#* The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
