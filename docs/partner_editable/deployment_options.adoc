This Quick Start provides three deployment options:

* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into a new VPC*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, eks cluster, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, autoscale group, route53, Redis database (optional), and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-product-short-name} into this new VPC.
* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into an existing VPC*. This option provisions {partner-product-short-name} in your existing AWS infrastructure.
* *Deploy a new tenant into an existing {partner-product-short-name} cluster*. This option adds a new tenant in the {partner-product-short-name} cluster in your existing AWS infrastructure.

The Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and {partner-product-short-name} settings, as discussed later in this guide.
