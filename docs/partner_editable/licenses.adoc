// Include details about any licenses and how to sign up. Provide links as appropriate. If no licenses are required, clarify that. The following paragraphs provide examples of details you can provide. Remove italics, and rephrase as appropriate.

* *Option 1*  No licenses are required to deploy this Quick Start. All AWS service resources consumed during the launch of the Quick Start incur AWS service usage costs. With this model, you can deploy one CNFW enforcement point, and the enforcement point's throughput will be rate-limited to 100 Kbps. 

* *Option 2* This Quick Start requires a license for SFCN. To use the Quick Start in your production environment, you are responsible for obtaining a license directly from the software vendor. If you don’t have a license, you can contact your Cisco accounts team to get a trial license. The trial license gives you 60 days of free usage in a non-production environment. After this time, you can upgrade to a production license by purchasing a license directly from the software vendor. 

// Or, if the deployment uses an AMI, update this paragraph. If it doesn’t, remove the paragraph.
The Quick Start requires a subscription to the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for {partner-product-short-name}, which is available from https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-mpk3c2gkda3w4. Additional pricing, terms, and conditions may apply. For instructions, see link:#step-2.-subscribe-to-the-software-ami[step 2] in the deployment section.
